block.omega-1-captains-log.name = Captain's Log
block.omega-1-captains-log.description = Stores information: [gray]I am recording this report instead of the captain because he is currently... let's say, unable to do so. On his initiative, we conducted extensive research on obtaining ethanol from biomaterial. I also had to create a censorship algorithm for the log — not because the captain says too much, but rather due to his... not entirely conventional vocabulary. \nSo, our spaceship 'Glass Eagle' was shot down during entry into Omega's atmosphere. We survived thanks to the Rescue Core and continued to carry out missions that were possible in our situation, according to protocol. \nIn a recently discovered sector, we found a ruined air purification base where the 'enemy' had entrenched themselves.

And that wasn't even the worst part - our ship fell into a damn acid ocean, and we survived only thanks to the Rescue Core, with which we managed to land on an island. Only three of us are left. I have no idea where the other Rescue Cores are - there were over a thousand of them, and most likely the majority fell into the acid. I understand that ROS wants to cut costs and not even install antennas in these cores - fine. But why don't the Louisiana States care about this? Is human life worth nothing to them? And as soon as we managed to establish a connection using a beacon, we were told: 'Continue the mission'. \nHow am I supposed to understand this? Hey - save your people!

All this time we were filling them in because they constantly interfered with the construction of new structures. We are running out of crystallite again; we might have to dismantle the robots we encountered, although that would deprive us of interesting research. Why doesn't ROS send us supplies or at least help? Why is there no antenna in the Rescue Core at all? We will need to file a complaint.

block.omega-2-log-of-team-lyon.name = Log of Team 'Lyon'
block.omega-2-log-of-team-lyon.description = Stores information: [gray]Entry 14: Our AIC named this sector Station 'Desert'. A strange name, but that peculiar mineral forming around the mercury remotely resembles sand... at least remotely, so that is likely why it is named so. We decided to set up robot production here to automate research and resource gathering, but for some reason, out of the entire list of robots, all turned out to be combat or even military units - there was not a single research or even cargo robot. This is strange. We were told that we are a research group, so why are there so many military technologies in the database?
