# Omega
is a large mod that adds a new planet with a full campaign, complete with its own extensive story and lore. The planet’s mechanics are connected to the standard mechanics of Serpulo — focusing on proper resource distribution and maximizing conveyor efficiency.
The overall goal of almost every sector is to capture the enemy base using your own units, sabotage tactics, and the gradual destruction of the enemy base’s systems. During gameplay, you will discover records and logs that reveal the story. Pay close attention to your surroundings and to the story-driven sectors themselves.

## Cobatstry?
I am also the author of Cobatstry, but I lost access to my account and can no longer update the mod. Many resources and even more sprites were transferred and reused in this project, but that is not a bad thing — focus on the new content, as this is a separate mod. In the story, Cobatstry can be considered the distant past.

## Mechanics and Features:

### Flags

Buildings that increase the maximum unit cap instead of cores. You can place them infinitely, so units are not overpowered, while the flags themselves are expensive and take a long time to build.

### Resource Management and Storage 
![flagImg](sprites/blocks/distribution/a9-items-station.png)

All buildings now have only the minimum required internal storage, and the core has a limited resource capacity. This forces you to either constantly expand production or build additional storage facilities.

### Distribution
![flagImg](sprites/blocks/distribution/a8-small-items-station.png)

Resource distribution is generally borrowed from Serpulo, but without a sorter. Use storages and unloaders instead. Energy distribution is also based on Serpulo’s system, but the starter and primary power nodes have only one connection point. This means that to transfer power between them, you need to either place them directly next to each other or use them in pairs.

### Logs and Records

Story notes and commentary appear in the technology tree during gameplay. They set the tone and gradually раскрывают the story and lore.
